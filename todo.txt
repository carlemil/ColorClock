implement settings:

* settings themes for the 3 "base" colors (h:m:s). (possibly a color picker if there is one ready to use.)

* add Khemer font if possible

* toggle for showing seconds ?

ideeas:

* use gradients as backgrounds allowing for 3 different colors to blend in one digit, h:m:s style, will not work on remote views :(

* multiple layouts to select from.
