ColorClock
==========

A clock widget for Android

A different approach to displaying time, hours, minutes and seconds are displayed using one color each, red for hours, green for minutes and blur for seconds. Denoting the 10's with a stronger version of the color. Have a look at the screenshots to get an ideea for how to read this clock.
Disclaimer: If your looking for a clock that is easy to read, this is NOT it.  


next step for dev:

implement settings:

* settings themes for the 3 "base" colors (h:m:s). (possibly a color picker if there is one ready to use.)

* add Khemer font if possible

* toggle for showing seconds ?

ideeas:

* use gradients as backgrounds allowing for 3 different colors to blend in one digit, h:m:s style, will not work on remote views :(

* multiple layouts to select from.
