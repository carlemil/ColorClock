ColorClock
==========

A clock widget for Android

A different approach to displaying time, hours, minutes and seconds are displayed using one color each, red for hours, green for minutes and blur for seconds. Denoting the 10's with a stronger version of the color. Have a look at the screenshots to get an ideea for how to read this clock.

Disclaimer: If your looking for a clock that is easy to read, this is NOT it.
